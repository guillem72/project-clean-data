### Description of the study 
One of the most exciting areas in all of data science right now is wearable computing - see for example [this article](http://www.insideactivitytracking.com/data-science-activity-tracking-and-the-battle-for-the-worlds-top-sports-brand/ "an article") . Companies like Fitbit, Nike, and Jawbone Up are racing to develop the most advanced algorithms to attract new users. This data represents data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone

### Sampling information
 The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data.

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain.

### Details about the data
The final **data** is the result of 
1. Mergin the test and the train sets, and tag each row with the corresponding subject 
2. Changed the activity from numerical value to nominal, in for a better description of the activity
3. Uses descriptive names for the variables
4. Only contains the average and standard deviation for each mesurement

And **data2** contains the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
